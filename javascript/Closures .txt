Q1) What is a Closure in JavaScript?
Ans:- Closure is feature in javascript. Where inner function can access the outer function variable
closer have access
1) closer it has access to own variable. which is define within curly bracess
2) it has to outer function variable 
3) it has access the globel variable 

Why to use closer :-
------------------
closures are commonly used to give objects data privacy. Data privacy is an essential property to make any type of software
And here In JavaScript.  closures are the primary mechanism used to enable data privacy

Example 1:-
 function collage(c_free){
  function collage_hostal(h_free){
      return c_free + h_free;
  }
  function collage_sports(s_free){
    return c_free + s_free;
  }
  function collage_library(l_free){
    return c_free + l_free;
  }
  return {
    collage_hostal:collage_hostal,
    collage_sports:collage_sports,
    collage_library:collage_library
  }
}
const a = collage(100);

console.log(a.collage_hostal(50));
console.log(a.collage_sports(40));
console.log(a.collage_sports(30));

output :
150
140
130

Example 2: It creates a unique scope for each iteration, storing each unique value of the variable within it's scope.

for(var i=0;i<5;i++){
  (function(x){
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log(x);
    },1000)
  })(i)
}
